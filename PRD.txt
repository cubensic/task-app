# Product Requirements Document: To-Do List Application

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** April 13, 2025  
**Author:** Product Management Team  

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for developing a minimalist To-Do List web application. The primary goal is to create a simple yet functional application that serves as an ideal first deployment project for learning deployment processes and basic full-stack development concepts.

### 1.2 Scope
The application will allow users to create, view, update, and delete tasks in a clean, straightforward interface, implementing fundamental CRUD operations with proper development, testing, and production environments.

### 1.3 Background
For developers learning to deploy their first web application, having a simple yet complete project with real-world functionality provides an ideal learning environment. This To-Do List application serves this purpose perfectly.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Vision
A minimalist, user-friendly To-Do List application that demonstrates fundamental web development concepts while providing genuine utility to users for managing tasks.

### 2.2 Target Audience
- Primary: Beginning developers learning deployment processes
- Secondary: End users seeking a simple task management solution

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 User Personas

**Persona 1: Developer (Alex)**
- Junior developer looking to practice deployment
- Familiar with basic coding concepts but new to deployment pipelines
- Wants to understand full-stack architecture through a practical example

**Persona 2: End User (Sam)**
- Needs a simple tool to track daily tasks
- Prefers minimal, straightforward interfaces
- Wants to quickly add, check off, and manage tasks

### 3.2 User Stories

1. As a user, I want to create new tasks so I can keep track of things I need to do.
2. As a user, I want to view all my tasks in a list so I can see everything at once.
3. As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so I can track my progress.
4. As a user, I want to edit task details so I can update information as needed.
5. As a user, I want to delete tasks so I can remove items that are no longer relevant.
6. As a user, I want to filter tasks by status so I can focus on what's still active.

  created_at: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
  ```

### 5.4 API Endpoints
- **TR-11:** System shall implement the following API endpoints:
  * `GET /api/tasks` - Retrieve all tasks (with optional status filter)
  * `GET /api/tasks/{id}` - Retrieve a specific task
  * `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
  * `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` - Update an existing task
  * `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` - Delete a task

### 5.5 Testing Requirements

1. User authentication and personalized task lists
2. Task categories/tags for better organization
3. Due dates and reminders for tasks
4. Task priority levels
5. Data visualization of completed vs. active tasks
6. Task sharing functionality

## 11. Success Criteria

### 11.1 Technical Success Metrics
